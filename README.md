# Minuten-addieren
This programm adds minutes to eu-time. You can change in the code from what time it should start and how many minutes it should add to the selected time. I hope it helped you.
It puts the minutes back to zero, when it hits 60. It puts the hours back to 0, when they hit 24. It is very usefull for bigger numbers that you can hardly calculate in your head.  
In the time I was programming i learnt a lot and it is realy fun and I want to get better.
